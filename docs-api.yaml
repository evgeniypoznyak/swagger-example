# Think about your API as separate app
# Clear Idea
# Don't confuse people
# Be clear
# Stay consistent (Pattern, structure)

# Base URL, next is RESOURCE, next Version



###  BASE ###
# 1. Do not use www in base
# 2. Keep your base URL simple
# 3. Use subdomain


### RESOURCE ###
# 1. Use NOUNS to identify resources
# 2. Plural is suggested:  /items /items/{id}  - go with plurals to your resources.
# 3. Avoid deep nesting (Max is 3 levels)
# 4. PUT - for entire update
# 5. PATCH - for partial update

### RESOURCE ###
# 1. private - only in browser
# 2. no-cache - nowhere (sensitive data should not be stored anywere)
# 3. ETag - values some kind a hash
            # API server compare ETag if not modified:
                                          # 304 Not Modified
                                      # if modified:
                                          # new data with new ETag value & 200 Status.
# 4.
